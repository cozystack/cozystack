## Features and Improvements

* **[kubernetes] Auto-enable Gateway API support in cert-manager**: cert-manager now automatically enables `enableGatewayAPI` when the Gateway API addon is active in the Kubernetes application. Users no longer need to manually configure this setting, and the option can still be overridden via `valuesOverride` ([**@kvaps**](https://github.com/kvaps) in #1997, #2012).

* **[vm] Allow switching between instancetype and custom resources**: Users can now switch virtual machines between instancetype-based and custom resource configurations after creation. The upgrade hook atomically patches VM resources, providing more flexibility in adjusting VM sizing without recreation ([**@sircthulhu**](https://github.com/sircthulhu) in #2008, #2013).

## Fixes

* **[dashboard] Add startupProbe to prevent container restarts on slow hardware**: Added `startupProbe` to both `bff` and `web` containers in the dashboard deployment. On slow hardware, kubelet was killing containers because the `livenessProbe` only allowed ~33 seconds for startup. The `startupProbe` gives containers up to 60 seconds to start before `livenessProbe` kicks in ([**@kvaps**](https://github.com/kvaps) in #1996, #2014).
