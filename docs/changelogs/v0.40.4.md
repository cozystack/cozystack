## Improvements

* **[kubernetes] Increase default apiServer resourcesPreset to large**: Increased the default resource preset for kube-apiserver to `large` to ensure more reliable operation under higher workloads and prevent resource constraints ([**@kvaps**](https://github.com/kvaps) in #1875, #1882).

* **[kubernetes] Increase kube-apiserver startup probe threshold**: Increased the startup probe threshold for kube-apiserver to allow more time for the API server to become ready, especially in scenarios with slow storage or high load ([**@kvaps**](https://github.com/kvaps) in #1876, #1883).

* **[etcd] Increase probe thresholds for better recovery**: Increased etcd probe thresholds to provide more time for recovery operations, improving cluster resilience during network issues or temporary slowdowns ([**@kvaps**](https://github.com/kvaps) in #1874, #1878).

## Fixes
