## Improvements

* **[linstor] Refactor node-level RWX validation**: Refactored the node-level ReadWriteMany (RWX) validation logic in LINSTOR CSI. The validation has been moved to the CSI driver level with a custom linstor-csi image build, providing more reliable RWX volume handling and clearer error messages when RWX requirements cannot be satisfied ([**@kvaps**](https://github.com/kvaps) in #1856, #1857).

## Fixes

* **[linstor] Remove node-level RWX validation**: Removed the problematic node-level RWX validation that was causing issues with volume provisioning. The validation logic has been refactored and moved to a more appropriate location in the LINSTOR CSI driver ([**@kvaps**](https://github.com/kvaps) in #1851).
