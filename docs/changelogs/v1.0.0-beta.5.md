-->

> **⚠️ Beta Release Warning**: This is a pre-release version intended for testing and early adoption. Breaking changes may occur before the stable v1.0.0 release.

## Features and Improvements

* **[installer] Add variant-aware templates for generic Kubernetes support**: Extended the installer chart to support generic and hosted Kubernetes deployments via the existing `cozystackOperator.variant` parameter. When using `variant=generic`, the installer now renders separate templates for the Cozystack operator, skipping Talos-specific components. This enables users to deploy Cozystack on standard Kubernetes distributions and hosted Kubernetes services, expanding platform compatibility beyond Talos Linux ([**@lexfrei**](https://github.com/lexfrei) in #2010).

* **[kilo] Add Cilium compatibility variant**: Added a new `cilium` variant to the kilo PackageSource that deploys kilo with the `--compatibility=cilium` flag. This enables Cilium-aware IPIP encapsulation where the outer packet IP matches the inner packet source, allowing Cilium's network policies to function correctly with kilo's WireGuard mesh networking. Users can now run kilo alongside Cilium CNI while maintaining full network policy enforcement capabilities ([**@kvaps**](https://github.com/kvaps) in #2055).

* **[cluster-autoscaler] Enable enforce-node-group-min-size by default**: Enabled the `enforce-node-group-min-size` option for the system cluster-autoscaler chart. This ensures node groups are always scaled up to their configured minimum size, even when current workload demands are lower, preventing unexpected scale-down below minimum thresholds and improving cluster stability for production workloads ([**@kvaps**](https://github.com/kvaps) in #2050).

* **[dashboard] Upgrade dashboard to version 1.4.0**: Updated the Cozystack dashboard to version 1.4.0 with new features and improvements for better user experience and cluster management capabilities ([**@sircthulhu**](https://github.com/sircthulhu) in #2051).

## Breaking Changes & Upgrade Notes

* **[vpc] Migrate subnets definition from map to array format**: Migrated VPC subnets definition from map format (`map[string]Subnet`) to array format (`[]Subnet`) with an explicit `name` field. This aligns VPC subnet definitions with the vm-instance `networks` field pattern and provides more intuitive configuration. Existing VPC deployments are automatically migrated via migration 30, which converts the subnet map to an array while preserving all existing subnet configurations and network connectivity ([**@kvaps**](https://github.com/kvaps) in #2052).

## Dependencies

* **[kilo] Update to v0.8.0**: Updated Kilo WireGuard mesh networking to v0.8.0 with performance improvements, bug fixes, and new compatibility features ([**@kvaps**](https://github.com/kvaps) in #2053).

* **[talm] Skip config loading for __complete command**: Fixed CLI completion behavior by skipping config loading for the `__complete` command, preventing errors during shell completion when configuration files are not available or misconfigured ([**@kitsunoff**](https://github.com/kitsunoff) in cozystack/talm#109).
