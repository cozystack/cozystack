## Fixes

* **[platform] Prevent cozystack-version ConfigMap from deletion**: Added resource protection to prevent the `cozystack-version` ConfigMap from being accidentally deleted, improving platform stability and reliability ([**@myasnikovdaniil**](https://github.com/myasnikovdaniil) in #2112, #2114).

* **[installer] Add keep annotation to Namespace and update migration script**: Added `helm.sh/resource-policy: keep` annotation to the `cozy-system` Namespace in the installer Helm chart to prevent Helm from deleting the namespace (and all HelmReleases within it) when the installer release is removed. The v1.0 migration script is also updated to annotate the `cozy-system` namespace and `cozystack-version` ConfigMap with this policy before migration ([**@kvaps**](https://github.com/kvaps) in #2122, #2123).

* **[dashboard] Add FlowSchema to exempt BFF from API throttling**: Added a `cozy-dashboard-exempt` FlowSchema to exempt the dashboard Back-End-for-Frontend (BFF) service account from Kubernetes API Priority and Fairness throttling. Previously, the BFF fell under the `workload-low` priority level, causing 429 (Too Many Requests) errors under load, resulting in dashboard unresponsiveness ([**@kvaps**](https://github.com/kvaps) in #2121, #2124).

## Documentation

* **[website] Replace bundles documentation with variants**: Renamed the "Bundles" documentation section to "Variants" to match current Cozystack terminology. Removed deprecated variants (`iaas-full`, `distro-full`, `distro-hosted`) and added new variants: `default` (PackageSources only, for manual package management via cozypkg) and `isp-full-generic` (full PaaS/IaaS on k3s, kubeadm, or RKE2). Updated all cross-references throughout the documentation ([**@kvaps**](https://github.com/kvaps) in cozystack/website#433).

* **[website] Add step to protect namespace before upgrading**: Updated the cluster upgrade guide and v0.41→v1.0 migration guide with a required step to annotate the `cozy-system` namespace and `cozystack-version` ConfigMap with `helm.sh/resource-policy=keep` before running `helm upgrade`, preventing accidental namespace deletion ([**@kvaps**](https://github.com/kvaps) in cozystack/website#435).
